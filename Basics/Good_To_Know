What is a container:
- A container is simply like a software unit/wrapper that will package everything - your application code, app related dependencies etc. together.
- You can assume like you get a portable environment to easily run your application. You can easily manage the container on your own (operations like starting, stopping, monitoring etc.).

Orchestration:
- A Container Orchestration tool or framework can help you in such situations. It can help you automate all the deployment/management overhead.
- Once such Container Orchestration tool is Kubernetes

Kubernetes:
- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of 
 containerized applications.
- It provides a set of abstractions and APIs for managing containers, so you can focus on building your application and not worryabout the underlying infrastructure.
- With Kubernetes, you can manage multiple containers across multiple machines, making it easier to streamline and automate the deployment and management of your application infrastructure.
- Kubernetes is fast becoming the de facto standard for container orchestration in the cloud-native ecosystem.
