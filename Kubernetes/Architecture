NOdes: is a machine - physical or virtual on which Kubernetes is installed. its a worker machine on whic application is installed.
there can be more than one NOdes

Cluster: is a set of nodes grouped together. 

Master: is another node and is responsible for managing the cluster.

Components installed with Kubernetes:
    - API Server - FE for Kubernetes
    - etcd - distributed key value store. used when we have multiple nodes and multiple masters. used to store all data used to manage the cluster
    - scheduler - distributing work or containers across multiple nodes. 
    - controller - brain behind orchestration. it makes decision when a node goes down.
    - container runtime - underlying software used to run containers . eg Docker
    - Kublet - agent that runs on each node in a cluster. responsible for making sure that the containers are running in each node as expected.

================================
Master Nodes : Worker Nodes

Master contains 
    </> kube-apiserver
    etcd
    scheduler
    controller

Worker contains 
    </> kublet
    container runtime (docker)

kubectl - kube command line tool
    kubectl run = is used to deploy an application on the cluster
    kubectl cluster-info = view info about cluster
    kubectl get nodes = list all the nodes as part of a cluster
